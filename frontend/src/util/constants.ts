## Abstract

**Objective:** To assess whether treatment with simvastatin reduces mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with existing coronary heart disease (CHD) and moderately elevated cholesterol.

**Design and Setting:** A multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in Scandinavian countries during the 1990s, sponsored by Merck. The study enrolled 4,444 participants with CHD and cholesterol levels of 5.5â€“8.0 mmol/L at 94 centers.

**Participants:** Adults with stable angina or prior myocardial infarction, and moderately raised cholesterol.

**Intervention:** Daily simvastatin versus placebo, administered over a median follow-up period.

**Main Outcome Measures:** Primary endpoint was overall mortality. Secondary endpoints included non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke events.

**Results:**
- Simvastatin treatment led to a **30% reduction in overall mortality** (p < 0.001).
- Non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke decreased significantly (37% and 28% reductions, respectively).
- Long-term follow-up showed sustained mortality benefit up to ten years.

**Conclusions:** The 4S trial provided compelling evidence that simvastatin significantly lowers risk of death and cardiovascular events in CHD patients, ushering in the era of statin therapy in secondary prevention.
