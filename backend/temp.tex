\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}

Sleep plays a critical role in cognitive functioning. This study
investigates the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive
performance in adults. Using standardized tests, we found that
individuals with 7-8 hours of sleep scored significantly higher than
those with less sleep. The findings suggest that adequate sleep is
essential for optimal cognitive performance.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Cognitive performance is influenced by numerous factors, with sleep
being one of the most significant. Prior research has demonstrated that
both sleep deprivation and excessive sleep can impair memory, attention,
and problem-solving skills {[}1,2{]}. This paper aims to explore the
effects of sleep duration on cognitive abilities in adults.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants}

A total of 100 adults aged 20-40 were recruited for this study.
Participants were grouped based on self-reported average sleep duration:
less than 6 hours, 7-8 hours, and more than 9 hours.

\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}

Participants completed a battery of cognitive tests including memory
recall, reaction time, and problem-solving tasks. Data was collected
over one week.

\subsubsection{Data Analysis}\label{data-analysis}

Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA to compare cognitive
scores across sleep duration groups.

\subsection{Results}\label{results}

The 7-8 hour sleep group demonstrated significantly better cognitive
test scores compared to both the less than 6 hours group (p \textless{}
0.01) and the more than 9 hours group (p \textless{} 0.05). Reaction
time was fastest, and memory recall accuracy highest in the 7-8 hour
group.

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}

The results align with previous studies indicating that 7-8 hours of
sleep is optimal for cognitive performance. Both insufficient and
excessive sleep durations negatively affect mental functions. These
findings highlight the importance of maintaining consistent sleep
schedules for cognitive health.

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

This study confirms the critical role of sleep duration in cognitive
performance. Future research should examine the impact of sleep quality
and other factors such as stress and diet.
